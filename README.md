##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took me approximately 10 hours, but most of that was just figuring out what to do. Actual implementation took about 3 hours.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 7


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> As already addressed in class, there is a little too much freedom. Which I understand is part of the assignment, but I feel if we had had the in-code examples and verbal description of the assignment during any class period before the one immediately prior to the due date, it would have gone better.
